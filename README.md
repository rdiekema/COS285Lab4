## Lab Summary

We were asked to create a GitHub repository, upload some common files, and
create our own branches to push individual contributions.

Lab was pretty straightforward, no issues. 


## Running the program

To run the program from the root of the directory.

```bash
java lab4/Lab4.java ./data.txt 
```
